# QuantumMentorshipProgramApplication

The following files are the application to the Quantum Mentorship program Cohort 8. 

[Task4.ipynb](https://github.com/fghisoni/QuantumMentorshipProgramApplication/blob/main/Task4.ipynb) and [Task4_functions.py](https://github.com/fghisoni/QuantumMentorshipProgramApplication/blob/main/Task4_functions.py) are the files for the main task. The notebook presents all the results, all the functions used for calculation alongside a description of each function can be found in the .py file.

Extra investigation were carried out concering the the scaling with a larger number of qubits as well as computational times in [Extra_Number_of_qubits.ipynb](https://github.com/fghisoni/QuantumMentorshipProgramApplication/blob/main/Extra_Number_of_qubits.ipynb). 

A further extra investigation concering the comparison with the noise model of a real superconducting device and can be found [Extra_Comparison_to_NISQ.ipynb](https://github.com/fghisoni/QuantumMentorshipProgramApplication/blob/main/Extra_Comparison_to_NISQ.ipynb). This notebook calls a number of functions from [Extra_Comparison_to_NISQ_functions.py](https://github.com/fghisoni/QuantumMentorshipProgramApplication/blob/main/Extra_Comparison_to_NISQ_functions.py).
